This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



Introduction

This is the project for the first half of the semester for course Microbiol 612.This project will analyze Gross Output Value of Agriculture from 1949 to 2013 of Shanghai, China. All the data collected in this project is from [Shanghai Statistical Bureau](www.stats-sh.gov.cn).    

Shanghai is the largest city of by population density, as 3,800 per square kilometers, not only in China, but also all around the world. As a result, a large amount of food are required for its development.

And try to find out the growing tendency of agriculture of Shanghai, of different categories.
    
    
    
Data Analysis  

```{r,echo=FALSE}
agri <- read.table(file="data.txt", header=T)
colnames(agri)[2] <- "Total"
colnames(agri)[5] <- "Animal"
colnames(agri)[7] <- "Service"
agri

```



1. Plots     

Total vs Year

```{r,echo=FALSE}
plot(agri$Total~agri$Year,xlab="Year",ylab="Value,100 million Yuan",main="Total Gross Output Value of Agriculture",type="l",lwd=2)
legend(1954.417,298.218,legend="Gross Output Value",lwd=2)
